# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

I think I should clarify the main points for the sample according to the purpose of my survey. 
Updated: 
Target population: entry- and lower-level employees who leave the company. 
Sampling frame: entry- and lower-level employees who go through the dismissal procedure.

I will create the Non-probability Purposive Survey Sample. To the sample will be selected all entry- and lower-level employees who leave the company for any reason and agreed to take a survey (these are sampling units).
In this case, sampling units will be the same as observational units (as noticed by the tutor in my previous assignment).

Below you can find my version from assignment `questionnaire-a`.
Implement the mandatory exit survey for the employees who are leaving the company. The purpose of this survey is to recognize the reasons for the turnover of entry- and lower-level employees to improve the company's personnel policy. The expectation is to collect and compare responses from different types of employees to understand the reasons for the turnover of entry- and lower-level employees.

Target population: entry- and lower-level employees.

Sampling frame: all employees who leave the company for any reasons.

Sampling units: each employee who goes through the dismissal procedure.

Observational units: individual responses.


2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

I see a few possibilities for improvements in my survey. 
- We should create the procedure for the survey and strictly determine the definition of "entry- and lower-level employees" and the timeline for conducting the survey.     
- We should protect the confidentiality of the respondents because this survey contains sensitive personnel information. For instance, exclude from the survey question about a name, organize this survey anonymously through an online platform, and include the paragraph about the purpose of this survey and confidentiality of the results. 
- Using online tools for survey can help us to escape non-responses (responder must choose some option for moving ahead).
- We should escape in the answers "All above"-options for getting measurable results.
- In my opinion, questions for the survey from assignment `questionnaire-a` overall are relevant but require an addition that helps us to receive deeper information about our target population. Next questions can be included in the survey:
    - What is your age? (give options for the answers in the categories 20 - 30 years old; 31 - 40,... - for protecting confidentiality)
    - What department did you work in? (generalizing the company structure at directions/divisions level in the answers) 
    - How often did you stay after work to finish your tasks? (this good option to confirm questions "Were you overwhelmed during the workday?")
    - How often did you take corporate training and courses? (this good option to confirm and specify questions "Did you have enough opportunities for professional development?")
    - Did you like your work schedule? 
    - Could you give us some advice for improvements in work culture? (open question) 

*** I can't understand what is the meaning of this request "Provide a link here for submission".
Below, are my questions for the survey from assignment `questionnaire-a`.
1. What was your last position in our company?
2. How long did you work in our company?
3. Were you satisfied with your salary?
4. Did you like the work relationship in your team?
5. Was your supervisor respectful and supportive? 
6. Was your supervisor open to professional discussion? 
7. Did you have enough opportunities to professional development? 
8. Were you satisfied with your job duties?
9. Were you overwhelmed during the workday?
10. Did you like our corporate culture?

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?
In this case, it is difficult (impossible) to fulfill the purpose of the survey with an observational study. We are interested to know the personal experiences, opinions and emotions of the respondents. All of these are hard to assess through the observations.  
    
## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:

	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric
