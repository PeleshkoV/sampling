| Weights | A weighting factor is available on the microdata file. WGHT_PER: This is the basic weighting factor for analysis at the person level, i.e. to calculate estimates of the number of persons having one or several given characteristics. Also, bootstrap weights for the purpose of design-based variance estimation. | The weights are based upon age, gender, education and province census distributions. All population data were taken from the 2016 Canadian census. | N/A This is not a survey. |
| Data processing | Data are collected directly from survey respondents. Processing used the SSPE set of generalized processing steps and utilities. | The survey responses will be collected anonymously through a secure online survey platform called Qualtrics. - Recoding sensetive information. - Removing dublicates and other errors. - Data Aggregation | N/A This is not a survey. |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc. | Error detection was done through edits programmed into the CATI system. Edits were performed automatically and manually at various stages of processing at macro and micro levels. Except in a few cases, all imputations were made using donor records selected through a score function. | Incomplete responses, duplicate responses of previous respondents, speeders, those who ‚Äústraight-lined‚Äù grid questions (‚Äústraightliners‚Äù), and respondents whose postal code didn‚Äôt match their province have all been removed from the data file, and are excluded from numbers reported. | N/A This is not a survey. |
| Sources of error | The sampling errors because the data are based on a sample of persons. The common sources of Non-sampling error are imperfect coverage and non-response. | Incompleted, dublicated responses | N/A This is not a survey. |
| Limitations, known biases | Non-response and response bias | Non-response and response bias | N/A This is not a survey. |
